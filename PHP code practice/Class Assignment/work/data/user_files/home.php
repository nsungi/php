 Increasing maize yield levels per unit area (productivity) is the major driver as 
 far as achieving food surplus is concerned in Tanzania. Improving maize productivity has immense benefits to the 

farmer and the nation at large.
 </p>
 <p>
 Basically, what a high productivity level means is that a farmer will be producing more for less in terms
  of fewer resources (variable costs) and less land area, which has positive implications
   on enterprise profitability and sustainability. At the farm level, increasing yield per unit area
    helps reduce the cost of producing a tonne of maize grain. 
 </p> 
  
 <h2>Maize production</h2>
 <p class="lead">
 importance of maize is centered on the large quality of carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins and fats,
  contained in the kernels, making it compare favorably as an energy source with root and tuber crops. 
 In Tanzania, an average of 1.5 tonnes of maize per hectare is produced.
 </p>
 
 <p>Most of this maize, in addition to being eaten directly as food, supports the local brewery industry, 
    where flour is fermented to produce many local brews.</p>
 <p>
 Improving the productivity of maize-based farming could significantly reduce hunger, enhance food security and
  alleviate poverty through increasing the purchasing power of the farmers.

    <h4>Techniques of increasing maize production</h4>
 <h6 class="lead">
   plant early and efficiency
</h6>
 <p>
 osing the right time to plant is often the most important part of planting.
  The best strategy to use to increase yields is: if your soil is ready, start planting. 
  There are tests you can perform on your soil to see if it is ready for planting.Planting early can 
 result in increased yields by taking advantage of unexpectedly early favorable soil conditions.
 </p> 
  
<h6 class="lead">Practice Seasonal Soil Rotation</h6>
<p>If you don’t have access to either, you may need to consider planting alternative crops in alternating 
    years — such as soybeans. Planting an alternating crop helps to diversify the demands on your soil. 
    This results in crops that not only yield more,
     but continually produce year in and year out.</p>

<h6 class="lead">know the Yield Potential</h6>
<p>Crop producers typically have an estimated idea of the yield potential of their seeds. 
    Understanding this will help manage not only your expectations,
     but whether or not your yield potential is matching your actual production.</p>

<h6 class="lead">Always Scout Your Fields</h6>
<p>This will give you a chance to assess soil conditions, notice any weeds cropping up,
     and check that your crops are growing healthily. There is a lot you can miss when you are passing by 
     your crops at high speeds, 
    so hitting the ground and examining your crops is an important step towards a stronger crop yield.</p>

<h6 class="lead">Ensure Proper Water Drainage</h6>
<p>It’s important to ensure your crop is getting enough water, but also that they aren’t being over-watered. 
    Developing a drainage system in your crops can help prevent
     water logging and salinization in your soil, both of which can stifle growth and production.</p>

<h6 class="lead">Utilize Fertilizers and test your soil</h6>
<p>cultvating your soil with fertilizers is an important part of maintaining optimal soil conditions for 
    crops on your farmland. Fertilizing your corn at the time of seeding 
    can help provide the seeds with essential nutrients like potassium, phosphorous, and calcium. </p>

<h6 class="lead">Seed Quality</h6>
<p>Having quality seeds is the basis for increasing crop yields. 
    Whether you are looking into increasing your corn yields, or maximizing your overall 
    agricultural productivity, you need to consider the strength of your seeds.
     Using hybrid seeds that are naturally inclined to grow faster, stronger, and with greater efficiency is pivotal to the success of your crops.
     Non-GMO seeds combine sustainability and cost seamlessly, which accounts for both quality and cost.</p>

Consideration of maize farming
    </h3>
    <p>Many economic and agronomic factors influence the productivity, 
        profitability and long-term success of farming.
    </p>
    <p>A number of these are within a producer’s control, as successful maize production depends 
        to a large extent on the farmer’s choices and correct application of production inputs</p>
        <p>Although farmers have no control over environmental stress conditions such as rain or drought, 
            certain practices can minimise these risks. Farmers can manipulate the environment in which they produce maize through hybrid choice,
             cultivation practices, soil conditioning and fertilisation, crop rotation, irrigation, and pest and disease control</p>
