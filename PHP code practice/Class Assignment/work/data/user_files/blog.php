    Start with a well-conditioned soil 

Soil pH is an excellent chemical indicator of soil quality (acidity/alkalinity) and 
its ability to avail nutrients to the crop. A well-conditioned soil has high Fertiliser Use Efficiency. 
Liming generally ‘sweetens’ acidic soils by correcting pH to optimum levels.
 The optimum pH range for maize is 5.5 to 6.5 based on a Calcium Chloride scale. 
    </p>
    <h6>It is therefore important to maintain or condition soils to optimum pH levels (5.5 to 6.5) for maize.
         This can be achieved by liming following recommendations from soil analysis results.</h6>

            </h3>
            <p class="card-text">Thorough land preparation is essential in maize if the crop is to be grown
                 productively and profitably. In fact, successful crop establishment is centred on good land preparation.
                 Conventional land preparation should target the following aspects:
 </p>
 <p>
   1.To loosen the soil and to form a fine tilth-this aids good seed-soil contact and emergence 
 </p> 
 <p>2.To control weeds and start on a weed-free</p>
 <p>3.To conserve moisture and improve drainage and water movement in the soil. </p>

             Start with the right seed variety 
            </h3>
            <p class="card-text">
            Choosing the right seed variety contributes significantly to increased yields per unit area. 
            A maize bumper harvest begins with choosing the right hybrid seed variety. 
            Farmers should always select hybrids with high yielding ability and good defensive agronomic
             traits that make them adapt to the current climatic and biotic conditions.
              Productive farmers target the right variety for their ecologies and use only certified seeds for 
              assurance of performance. SC719, SC649, and SC612 are suitable for areas with medium to high rainfall
               while series like SC651, SC510, and SC645 are suitable for areas with low rainfall patterns.

    general life cycle of maize
    </h3>
    <p>he Lifecycle of Maize: From Seed to Harvest": Detail the step-by-step process of growing maize,
         starting from seed selection and planting to cultivation, pollination, and harvesting. 
        Include tips and best practices for each stage to guide farmers or gardening enthusiasts.</p>

        <p>Maize is a cereal crop. It contains carbohydrates which are needed by both humans and animals for energy.
             Maize is used to produce close to 50% of carbohydrate foods in Tanzania. It is used to prepare banku, porridge, kenkey, tuo-zaafi among others. 
            It grows well in loamy soil. Maize grows well directly on the field just like okro.</p>

            <p>Maize reproduces sexually each year. A minimum of 2-3 seeds are placed in a hole of 4-5cm deep.
                 The planting arrangement must be well done in order to allow aeration and prevent overcrowding.
                  The spacing is averagely 80-90cm between rows and 50-60cm between holes. 
                Maize takes 90-120 days to be fully matured.</p>
